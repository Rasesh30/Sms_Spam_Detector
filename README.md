# Sms_Spam_Detector
# Project Description
This assignment involved restructuring code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that builds a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. After constructing the model, Gradio was used to deploy and test the application. The app allows users to input text and receive feedback on whether it is classified as spam or not, based on the model's predictions.

The code is written by me with the use of my class notes I took during class
